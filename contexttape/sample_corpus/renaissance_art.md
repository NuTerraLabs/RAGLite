# Renaissance Art — A brief overview

The Renaissance (14th–17th centuries) introduced naturalism, perspective, and humanism in European art.
Techniques like **linear perspective** (popularized by Brunelleschi) and **chiaroscuro** created depth and realism.
Patronage—especially by the **Medici**—fueled the careers of artists such as **Leonardo da Vinci**, **Michelangelo**, and **Raphael**.
Subjects included classical mythology, religious narratives, and portraits of civic leaders.
