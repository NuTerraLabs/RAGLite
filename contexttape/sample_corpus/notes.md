# Photosynthesis — Overview

Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. In plants, this occurs in chloroplasts.
**Light-dependent reactions** happen in the thylakoid membranes and generate **ATP** and **NADPH** by using sunlight to split water (photolysis), releasing **O₂**.

**Calvin cycle** (light-independent reactions) occurs in the stroma and fixes **CO₂** into **G3P**, ultimately forming glucose. The simplified overall equation:

```
6 CO₂ + 6 H₂O + light → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6 O₂
```

Key terms: chlorophyll, photosystems II and I (PSII/PSI), electron transport chain, proton gradient, RuBisCO, carbon fixation.
